k8s-dev is a simple CLI tool that integrates with Vagrant to enable users to define, develop,
and test Ansible playbooks and roles, and Helm charts. It allows users to define and manage infrastructure
resources and uses the providers automation engine to provision and run a consistent repeatble environment.

By utilizing Ansible's playbooks, roles, and charts, developers and engineers can automate the deployment
of software applications across multiple consistent kubernetes clusters, reducing the time and effort
required to manage complex infrastructure environments.
